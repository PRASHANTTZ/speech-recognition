# speech-recognition
The main objective of my project is the implementation of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system using the Kaldi-ASR toolkit and then improve its performance by extracting the bottleneck features from the data and training the system using tandem neural networks over triphone models. The neural network implementation was carried out using Kaldi-PDNN. The obtained performance of the system by extracting bottleneck features was compared with other neural network based models and the HMM-based models  and it was found to give a good improvement over the other methods.
